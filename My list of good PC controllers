# 🕹️ Best PC Controllers of 2025 (TMR Joystick Era)

**Updated: 2025**

2025 is the year of **TMR joysticks**. After Hall Effect sensors dominated the last few years, **TMR (Tunnel MagnetoResistance)** is now the industry hype. These sticks feel smoother, are slightly more precise (especially for FPS games), and show great consistency in long-term use.

I’ve tested most of the popular TMR-based controllers available this year. While there’s no perfect all-in-one gamepad, each one has its strengths — and weaknesses. Below is a list of what each controller does best, along with a detailed comparison table.

## 🎯 Final Verdict

My current top pick is the **GameSir Cyclone 2** — it nails the essentials with excellent analog triggers, responsive inputs, and comfortable design. If you want the most precise FPS controller, **Blitz 2** is unbeatable in latency. For a PS-style layout, **Tarantula Pro** is your go-to (despite the so-so membrane buttons).
